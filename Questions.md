1. Project Definition

    Question: "What constitutes a 'project'? Is it tied to a specific feature, a deliverable, or something else?"
    Expected Answer: "A project could be a client request, an internal product feature, or a deliverable in the broader context of a development cycle."

2. User Roles and Permissions

    Question: "Who can leave comments and change the project status? Should we distinguish between user roles (e.g., admins, team members, clients)?"
    Expected Answer: "Only team members can leave comments and change statuses. Clients can only view the conversation history but cannot modify it."

3. Status Workflow

    Question: "What statuses should the project support (e.g., 'Open', 'In Progress', 'Completed', etc.)?"
    Expected Answer: "The project should have many statuses."

4. Comments and Activity Log

    Question: "Should comments and status changes be treated the same in the conversation history, or should they be visually separated?"
    Expected Answer: "Yes, they should be presented in the same conversation feed, with a clear indication of whether it's a comment or a status change."

5. Editing and Deleting Comments/Status

    Question: "Should users be able to edit or delete comments and status changes after they've been made?"
    Expected Answer: "No, once a comment is added or the status is changed, it should be immutable to maintain a reliable project history."

6. Notification System

    Question: "Should users be notified of new comments or status changes via email or any other method?"
    Expected Answer: "For now, no notifications are needed. We’ll focus on the conversation history within the app."

7. Pagination and Limits

    Question: "Should the conversation history be paginated if there are a large number of comments and status changes?"
    Expected Answer: "Yes, let's paginate it after 20 entries for performance reasons."

8. Sorting

    Question: "Should the conversation history be sorted by date, from the oldest to the most recent?"
    Expected Answer: "Yes, sort it from the oldest to the most recent to provide a proper chronological view of the project’s progression."

9. Time Spent

    Question: "Is the 3-hour time limit a hard constraint? Should I prioritize certain features over others?"
    Expected Answer: "Yes, the 3-hour limit is strict. Focus on the core functionality: posting comments and updating project status, and listing both in the conversation history."
